# <NoteTaker>

## Description

This is an app built from existing front-end code in which I practiced creting servers with modularized routing for the first time. It allows a user to maksave notes and see them persisting whenever they load them. This gave me increased practice in Node.js and servers in general.

## Installation

No steps required, just visit site and use! Hooray.

## Usage

Navigate to site [here](https://notetaker-edx-112358.herokuapp.com/notes). Click get started, and you'll be able to see your notes and add new ones. The delete functionality is still to come.
