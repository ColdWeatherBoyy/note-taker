# <NoteTaker>

## Description

This is an app built from existing front-end code in which I practiced creting servers with modularized routing for the first time. It allows a user to maksave notes and see them persisting whenever they load them. This gave me increased practice in Node.js and servers in general, as well as GET, POST, and DELETE requests.
